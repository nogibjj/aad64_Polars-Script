Week 3 Mini-Project

This assignment is designed to introduce us to polars descriptive scripts. For the same, the main edit made was to add polars==2.1.0 to my requirements.txt file.

Here, I have created a project which calculates the mean of a given dataset input, and returns the result. I have also created a test file to ensure that the mean function is correctly functioning (using an assert function).

The contents of this project are: 
* .devcontainer (with a [devcontainer.json](https://github.com/nogibjj/aad64_Polars-Script/edit/main/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) and a [Dockerfile](https://github.com/nogibjj/aad64_Polars-Script/edit/main/.devcontainer/Dockerfile)), 
* [Github Actions](https://github.com/nogibjj/aad64_Polars-Script/edit/main/.github/workflows/actions.yml), 
* .gitignore file, 
* [Makefile](https://github.com/nogibjj/aad64_Polars-Script/edit/main/Makefile), 
* [requirements.txt](https://github.com/nogibjj/aad64_Polars-Script/edit/main/requirements.txt), 
* [main.py](https://github.com/nogibjj/aad64_Polars-Script/edit/main/main.py), 
* [test_main.py](https://github.com/nogibjj/aad64_Polars-Script/edit/main/test_main.py), and 
* iris.csv.
